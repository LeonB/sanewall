		server apcupsd accept
	NOTES
		This service must be defined as "server apcupsd accept" on
		all machines not directly connected to the UPS (i.e. slaves).
		-
		Note that the port defined here is not the default port (6666)
		used if you download and compile APCUPSD, since the default
		conflicts with IRC and many distributions (like Debian) have
		changed this to 6544.
		-
		You can define port 6544 in APCUPSD, by changing the value
		of NETPORT in its configuration file, or overwrite this
		sanewall service definition using the procedures described
		in <xref linkend="adding-services"/>
		of <xref linkend="sanewall.conf"/>.

	HOME  http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net
	EXAMPLE
		server dcpp accept

SERVICE dhcp
	NAME Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhcp
	CPORT 68
	SPORT udp/67
	EXAMPLE
		server dhcp accept
	NOTES
		The dhcp service is implemented as stateless rules.
		-
		DHCP clients broadcast to the network (src 0.0.0.0
		dst 255.255.255.255) to find a DHCP server. If the DHCP
		service was stateful the iptables connection tracker would
		not match the packets and deny to send the reply.
		-
		Note that this change does not affect the security of either
		DHCP servers or clients, since only the specific ports are
		allowed (there is no random port at either the server or the
		client side).
		-
		Note also that the "server dhcp accept" or "client dhcp accept"
		commands should placed within interfaces that do not
		have src and / or dst defined (because of the initial
		broadcast).
		-
		You can overcome this problem by placing the DHCP service on
		a separate interface, without a src or dst but with a policy
		return. Place this interface before the one that defines the
		rest of the services.
		-
		For example:
		<programlisting>
		interface eth0 dhcp
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;policy return
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server dhcp accept
		&nbsp;
		interface eth0 lan src "$mylan" dst "$myip"
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client all accept
		</programlisting>

SERVICE dhcprelay
	NAME DHCP Relay
	EXAMPLE
		server dhcprelay accept
	NOTES
		From RFC 1812 section 9.1.2:
		-
		In many cases, BOOTP clients and their associated BOOTP
		server(s) do not reside on the same IP (sub)network. In
		such cases, a third-party agent is required to transfer
		BOOTP messages between clients and servers. Such an agent
		was originally referred to as a BOOTP forwarding agent.
		However, to avoid confusion with the IP forwarding function
		of a router, the name BOOTP relay agent has been adopted
		instead.
		-
		For more information about DHCP Relay see section 9.1.2 of
		<ulink url="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1812.txt?number=1812">RFC 1812</ulink>

	EXAMPLE
		server dns accept
	NOTES
		On very busy DNS servers you may see a few dropped DNS
		packets in your logs. This is normal. The iptables
		connection tracker will timeout the session and lose
		unmatched DNS packets that arrive too late to be useful.

SERVICE microsoft_ds
	NAME Direct Hosted (NETBIOS-less) SMB
	ALIAS ms_ds
	EXAMPLE
		server microsoft_ds accept
	NOTES
		Direct Hosted (i.e. NETBIOS-less SMB)
		-
		This is another NETBIOS Session Service with minor
		differences with <xref linkend="service-netbios_ssn"/>.
		It is supported only by Windows 2000 and Windows XP and
		it offers the advantage of being independent of WINS for
		name resolution.
		-
		It seems that samba supports transparently this protocol
		on the <xref linkend="service-netbios_ssn"/> ports, so
		that either direct hosted or traditional SMB can be served
		simultaneously.
		-
		Please refer to the <xref linkend="service-netbios_ssn"/>

SERVICE netbios_dgm
	NAME NETBIOS Datagram Distribution Service
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbios#Datagram_distribution_service
	EXAMPLE
		server netbios_dgm accept
	NOTES
		See also the <xref linkend="service-samba"/> service.
		-
		Keep in mind that this service broadcasts (to the broadcast
		address of your LAN) UDP packets. If you place this service
		within an interface that has a dst parameter, remember to
		include (in the dst parameter) the broadcast address of your
		LAN too.

SERVICE netbios_ns

		See also the <xref linkend="service-samba"/> service.

SERVICE netbios_ssn
	NAME NETBIOS Session Service
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbios#Session_service
	EXAMPLE
		server netbios_ssn accept
	NOTES
		See also the <xref linkend="service-samba"/> service.
		-
		Please keep in mind that newer NETBIOS clients prefer to use
		port 445 (<xref linkend="service-microsoft_ds"/>) for the
		NETBIOS session service, and when this is not available they
		fall back to port 139 (netbios_ssn). Versions of samba above
		3.x bind automatically to ports 139 and 445.
		-
		If you have an older samba version and your policy on an
		interface or router is DROP, clients trying to access port
		445 will have to timeout before falling back to port 139.
		This timeout can be up to several minutes.
		-
		To overcome this problem you can explicitly REJECT the
		<xref linkend="service-microsoft_ds"/> service with a
		tcp-reset message:
		-
		server microsoft_ds reject with tcp-reset

SERVICE nfs
	NAME Network File System
	WIKI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System_%28protocol%29
	SPORT many
	EXAMPLE
		client nfs accept dst 192.0.2.1
	NOTES
		The NFS service queries the RPC service on the NFS server
		host to find out the ports nfsd, mountd, lockd and rquotad
		are listening. Then, according to these ports it sets up
		rules on all the supported protocols (as reported by RPC)
		in order the clients to be able to reach the server.
		-
		For this reason, the NFS service requires that:
		-
		<simplelist>
		<member>the firewall is restarted if the NFS server is restarted</member>
		<member>the NFS server must be specified on all nfs statements (only if it is not the localhost)</member>
		</simplelist>
		-
		Since NFS queries the remote RPC server, it is required to
		also be allowed to do so, by allowing the
		<xref linkend="service-portmap"/> service too. Take care that
		this is allowed by the running firewall when sanewall tries
		to query the RPC server. So you might have to setup NFS in
		two steps: First add the portmap service and activate the
		firewall, then add the NFS service and restart the firewall.
		-
		To avoid this you can setup your NFS server to listen on
		pre-defined ports, as documented in
		<ulink url="http://nfs.sourceforge.net/nfs-howto/ar01s06.html#nfs_firewalls">NFS Howto</ulink>.
		If you do this then you will have to define the the ports
		using the procedure described
		in <xref linkend="adding-services"/>
		of <xref linkend="sanewall.conf"/>.

	NOTES
		The nis service queries the RPC service on the nis server

		Then, according to these ports it sets up rules on all the
		supported protocols (as reported by RPC) in order the clients

		-
		This service was added to FireHOL by
		<ulink url="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=487695&aid=1050951&group_id=58425">Carlos Rodrigues</ulink>.
		His comments regarding this implementation, are:
		-
		These rules work for client access only!
		-
		Pushing changes to slave servers won't work if these rules
		are active somewhere between the master and its slaves,
		because it is impossible to predict the ports where yppush
		will be listening on each push.
		-
		Pulling changes directly on the slaves will work, and could
		be improved performance-wise if these rules are modified to
		open fypxfrd. This wasn't done because it doesn't make that
		much sense since pushing changes on the master server is
		the most common, and recommended, way to replicate maps.

SERVICE samba
	NAME Samba
	CPORT default
	SPORT many
	EXAMPLE
		server samba accept
	NOTES
		The samba service automatically sets all the rules for
		<xref linkend="service-netbios_ns"/>,
		<xref linkend="service-netbios_dgm"/>,
		<xref linkend="service-netbios_ssn"/> and
		<xref linkend="service-microsoft_ds"/>.
		-
		Please refer to the notes of the above services for more
		information.
		-
		NETBIOS initiates based on the broadcast address of an
		interface (request goes to broadcast address) but the server
		responds from its own IP address. This makes the
		"server samba accept" statement drop the server reply,
		because of the way the iptables connection tracker works.
		-
		This service definition includes a hack, that allows a
		Linux samba server to respond correctly in such situations,
		by allowing new outgoing connections from the well known
		<xref linkend="service-netbios_ns"/> port to the clients
		high ports.
		-
		However, for clients and routers this hack is not applied
		because it would open all unprivileged ports to the samba
		server. The only solution to overcome the problem in such
		cases (routers or clients) is to build a trust relationship
		between the samba servers and clients.
