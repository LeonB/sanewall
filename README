                  Sanewall - making sense of firewalling

Sanewall is a firewall builder for iptables which uses an elegant language.
It allows you to create very readable configurations even for complex
stateful firewalls.

Simple but useful firewalls need only a few lines of configuration. Very
complex with flow control and external commands can be created by using
bash (http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) commands in-line with the standard
configuration language.

Sanewall can be used to produce local firewalls or router-based firewalls
on any system that bash and iptables are available including full GNU/Linux
servers and embedded routers such as OpenWRT (http://www.openwrt.org/).


Goals
=====
The main goals of the sanewall project are:
  - Allow experts and non-experts alike to produce secure firewalls
  - Simple configuration should be simple
  - Complex configuration should be possible (and as easy as possible)
  - Maintain compatibility with old FireHOL configurations
  - Eliminate distinctions between IPv4 and IPv6 wherever possible
  - Keep to a minimal set of dependencies

This is achieved by providing an expressive, easy-to-read, write and
understand configuration language geared specifically to firewalls
(a Domain Specific Language).

The language is sufficiently brief, well-structured and meaningful that
a human can manage the firewall rules without the need for additional tools.
The use of a simple text-file for configuration allows for optimal use
with version control and file-comparison tools.


Getting Started
===============
If you want to install the package from source or the tar-file from the
website, please read the file INSTALL first.

When you first install the program you need to set your configuration in
the file /etc/sanewall/sanewall.conf. Either start from an examples:
  client-all.conf     -  Simplest firewall for a standalone system (installed
                         by default)
  lan-gateway.conf
  server-dmz.conf
  office.conf

Alternatively, run:
  sanewall wizard

Sanewall will try to generate a configuration tailored to the machine
it is running on.

Adding additional services
--------------------------
In addition to defining extra services in the sanewall.conf file, it is
possible to define new services by putting extra config files into the
/etc/sanewall/services directory.

Every file with the ending .conf gets parsed. Config files should start
with a special header:

#FHVER: 1:213

Which was originally defined within FireHOL. 1 is the API version and
will be updated if a backwards-incompatible change is introduced. 213
was the minimum version of FireHOL the service was expected to work with
and is ignored in sanewall.

The format for service definition is the same as for adding a service
to the main configuration file. See here for details:
  http://www.sanewall.org/

An example is provided in bittorrent.conf in the documentation folder.

Waiting for a network device
----------------------------
If you want to have sanewall to wait until a network device is up before
it creates the firewall rules you can set the name of the device in the
environment variable WAIT_FOR_IFACE.

Sanewall will wait until the devices is up or until 60 seconds have elapsed.

Note that your device does not need to be up in order to create the firewall
so this option should only be used if you have a specific need to wait.

History
=======
Sanewall is a fork of FireHOL (http://firehol.sourceforge.net/) which was
made when development of that project stalled. A great deal is owed to that
project and Costa Tsaousis for originating it. All existing FireHOL
definitions should be compatible with sanewall.
