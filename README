                 Sanewall - making sense of firewalling
                 **************************************

Sanewall is a firewall builder for iptables which uses an elegant language.
It allows you to create very readable configurations even for complex
stateful firewalls.

Simple but useful firewalls need only a few lines of configuration. Very
complex with flow control and external commands can be created by using
bash (http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) commands in-line with the standard
configuration language.

Sanewall can be used to produce local firewalls or router-based firewalls
on any system that bash and iptables are available including full GNU/Linux
servers and embedded routers such as OpenWRT (http://www.openwrt.org/).


History
=======
Sanewall is a fork of FireHOL (http://firehol.sourceforge.net/) which was
made when development of that project stalled. A great deal is owed to that
project and Costa Tsaousis for originating it. All existing FireHOL
definitions should be compatible with sanewall.


Goals
=====
The main goals of the sanewall project are:
  - Allow experts and non-experts alike to produce secure firewalls
  - Simple configuration should be simple
  - Complex configuration should be possible (and as easy as possible)
  - Maintain compatibility with old FireHOL configurations
  - Eliminate distinctions between IPv4 and IPv6 wherever possible
  - Keep to a minimal set of dependencies

This is achieved by providing an expressive, easy-to-read, write and
understand configuration language geared specifically to firewalls
(a Domain Specific Language).

The language is sufficiently brief, well-structured and meaningful that
a human can manage the firewall rules without the need for additional tools.
The use of a simple text-file for configuration allows for optimal use
with version control and file-comparison tools.

Support and documentation
=========================
The main website is here:
   http://www.sanewall.org/

Man pages, PDF and HTML documentation are provided as part of the package
and can be found in the tarball or in your distribution's standard locations
(e.g. /usr/share/doc).

For tutorial and guided learning the best place currently is still the
FireHOL documentation, here:
   http://firehol.sourceforge.net/

Until forum software is established, the best place to post questions and
ask for help is the mailing list:
   http://lists.sanewall.org/mailman/listinfo/sanewall-dev

Don't worry if you're not interested in developing sanewall, the list is
low volume and everyone is friendly.
