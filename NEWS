Release of version 0.9.9

This version now uses GNU autotools so you can run:
  ./configure && make && make install

in the usual way. Note that the default is to install under /usr/local,
so if you have previously installed from source, you may want to run
configure more like this instead:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

Read the INSTALL file and ./configure --help for more information.
