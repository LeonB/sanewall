Development series 1.1.0 starts

Adds IPv6 support

Can be invoked as:
  sanewall [whatever]     -- "Both" mode (default)
  sanewall -4 [whatever]  -- IPv4 mode (should show original behaviour)
  sanewall -6 [whatever]  -- IPv6 mode (ip6tables only)

Please make sure you read the "Known Issues" and "IPv6 Support" sections
of the README. If you choose to use this development version, please take
the time to audit the output and ensure it meets your expectations and
report any bugs or unexpected behaviour to the mailing list or bug tracker.

Rename these configuration files (if you have them, they are optional):
  RESERVED_IPS   ->   RESERVED_IPV4s
  PRIVATE_IPS    ->   PRIVATE_IPV4
  MULTICAST_IPS  ->   MULTICAST_IPV4

There are new (optional) files for IPv6 addresses:
  RESERVED_IPV6, PRIVATE_IPV6 and MULTICAST_IPV6

Release of version 1.0.0

No functional changes from 0.9.10.

Slight changes to README, license snippet in script brought in line with
recommended wording.


2013/04/13:

Release of version 0.9.10

This version allows certain variables to be set via the environment as
well as via the sanewall.conf file.

See the PDF/HTML manual or sanewall-variables manpage for details.


2013/04/06:

Release of version 0.9.9

This version now uses GNU autotools so you can run:
  ./configure && make && make install

in the usual way. Note that the default is to install under /usr/local,
so if you have previously installed from source, you may want to run
configure more like this instead:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

Read the INSTALL file and ./configure --help for more information.


2013/03/23:

Release of version 0.9.8
