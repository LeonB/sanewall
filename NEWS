Release of version 1.1.2

Fix kernel version detection so that it is more flexible and less error
prone (3.8-1-amd64 was breaking the original).

Configure script makes sanewall executable. The unconfigured sanewall.in
issues a warning when it is run directly.

Configure script now sets /usr/local/etc as the location for Sanewall
to look in as well as store configuration files in if --sysconfdir is not
given, solving http://bugs.sanewall.org/sanewall/issues/78

Allow switching on of debug output by setting environment variable
SANEWALL_DEBUGGING to a non-empty value.

Handle domain names that refer to records that are IPv4, IPv6 or both
(previously they were assumed to be IPv4 only).

Fix protection against direct use of /sbin/iptables and /sbin/ip6tables
that were broken from 1.1.0.

Note that the fixes to IPv4/IPv6 matching from version 1.1.1 also had
the effect of resolving the problems previosly associated with "src not"
on all rules and "src" on some. Both of these constructs should now be
fine to use without an ipv4/ipv6 prefix. Note however that:
   server ssh accept src not some-IPv4

Accepts all non-matching IPv4 addresses and all IPv6 addresses (since none
match) so if you want to stop ipv6 addresses you need to do so by limiting
the rule to IPv4 space:
   ipv4 server ssh accept src not some-IPv4

Release of version 1.1.1

When startup fails, both IPv4 and IPv6 firewalls are correctly restored.

Fixes "mac" helper command for versions of iptables 1.4.12+ as per 1.0.1
and also prevent mac addresses being seen as IPv6 addresses.

Added a regression test framework.

Improve IPv4/IPv6 address matching (some internal names such as mark.1 were
being identified as IPv4 only).

Development series 1.1.0 starts

Adds IPv6 support

Can be invoked as:
  sanewall [whatever]     -- "Both" mode (default)
  sanewall -4 [whatever]  -- IPv4 mode (should show original behaviour)
  sanewall -6 [whatever]  -- IPv6 mode (ip6tables only)

Please make sure you read the "Known Issues" and "IPv6 Support" sections
of the README. If you choose to use this development version, please take
the time to audit the output and ensure it meets your expectations and
report any bugs or unexpected behaviour to the mailing list or bug tracker.

Rename these configuration files (if you have them, they are optional):
  RESERVED_IPS   ->   RESERVED_IPV4
  PRIVATE_IPS    ->   PRIVATE_IPV4
  MULTICAST_IPS  ->   MULTICAST_IPV4

There are new (optional) files for IPv6 addresses:
  RESERVED_IPV6, PRIVATE_IPV6 and MULTICAST_IPV6


2013/04/24:

Release of version 1.0.0

No functional changes from 0.9.10.

Slight changes to README, license snippet in script brought in line with
recommended wording.


2013/04/13:

Release of version 0.9.10

This version allows certain variables to be set via the environment as
well as via the sanewall.conf file.

See the PDF/HTML manual or sanewall-variables manpage for details.


2013/04/06:

Release of version 0.9.9

This version now uses GNU autotools so you can run:
  ./configure && make && make install

in the usual way. Note that the default is to install under /usr/local,
so if you have previously installed from source, you may want to run
configure more like this instead:
  ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

Read the INSTALL file and ./configure --help for more information.


2013/03/23:

Release of version 0.9.8
