                        Sanewall Installation
                        *********************

These instructions apply to packages downloaded from:
   http://download.sanewall.org/releases

If you have installed sanewall via your distribution, there may be some
differences.

Once you have installed sanewall, read the Getting Started section of
the README.

Installing from the tar-file
============================
Obtain the distribution file. It will look something like:
   sanewall-x.y.z.tar.gz

To install you just need to perform the following steps:
  1. Unpack and change directory:
       tar xvfz sanewall-x.y.z.tar.gz
       cd sanewall-x.y.z

  2. Copy sanewall script to /usr/sbin:
       sudo cp sanewall /usr/sbin

  3. If you are replacing FireHOL you should just be able to create the
     sanewall configuration by copying the FireHOL config:
       sudo cp -rp /etc/firehol /etc/sanewall
       sudo mv /etc/firehol/firehol.conf /etc/sanewall/sanewall.conf

     Otherwise, create a default configuration if this is your first
     installation:
       sudo mkdir /etc/sanewall
       sudo cp examples/client-all.conf /etc/sanewall/sanewall.conf

  4. Run sanewall to generate your new iptables firewall:
       sudo sanewall start

  5. Documentation is under the doc and man directories:
       sudo cp -r man/man* /usr/man
       sudo cp doc /usr/share/doc/sanewall

Note that you will also want to ensure that sanewall runs at boot-time. How
you do so depends on your distribution. The binary can be used directly in
/etc/init.d on many systems. In addition, some example init scripts are
available here:
  http://bugs.sanewall.org/wiki/Init_Scripts


Building/Installing from Source
===============================
As sanewall is a shell script there is no compilation step as such, however
there is a Makefile which stamps the version into the file, builds the
documentation and creates the final tar-file.

To perform a build you will need the following packages:
   perl
   xmllint
   xsltproc
   docbook-xml
   docbook-xsl
   fop

The Makefile has the following editable variables at the top:
  DB_XSL_BASE   -   path to docbook-xsl stylesheets
  PAPERTYPE     -   paper type for PDF (e.g. A4, letter)

If you do not wish to build the documentation or the non-source tar-file,
you can simply copy the files in much the same manner as described in
"Installing from the tar-file".
