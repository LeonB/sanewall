                         Sanewall Regression Tests
                         *************************

WARNING: your firewall is cleared out before starting and after finishing
and will go through a number or arbitrary states. DO NOT RUN these tests
unless you are protected by a firewall elsewhere on your network.

Run tests as:
  sudo ./regress -ok versions...

e.g.:
  sudo ./regress -ok firehol current 1.0.0 1.1.0

To get comparisons between FireHOL, the current sanewall.in in the working
directory edits and all and tagged Sanewall versions 1.0.0 and 1.1.0.

Any number of versions may be specified.

You will need to have a local branch called firehol-cvs-mirror in order to
run the FireHOL version. The recommended source is the cvs-mirror branch
from here:
  https://github.com/philwhineray/firehol-fork.git

Any .conf files under the tests directory will be run one by one for each
version.

Output goes into output/<version> directories - old data will be removed
before the new tests are run:
  output/<version>/*.log             - stdout+stderr from run
  output/<version>/*.out             - iptables-save output
  output/<version>/ipv4-no-nat/*.out - iptables-save output with nat removed
  output/<version>/ipv6/*.out        - ip6tables-save output

Output is slightly munged to minimise the differences between runs and
between iptables-save and ip6tables-save output. See tools/run-suite.sh
for the details.


Comparison examples
===================
Compare FireHOL to Sanewall first official release behaviour:
  diff -r output/FireHOL output/1.0.0

Compare Sanewall IPv4 only to Sanewall with IPv6 behaviour:
  diff output/1.0.0 output/1.1.0
(no point in comparing subdirectories since IPv6 is different by definition)

Compare Sanewall IPv4 output to Sanewall IPv6 output in both-capable version:
  diff output/1.1.0/ipv4-no-nat output/1.1.0/ipv6

Compare last released to current edit behaviour:
  diff -r output/1.1.0 output/current

Compare IPv4 to IPv6 in current edit
  diff output/current/ipv4-no-nat output/current/ipv6

Compare effect of activation policy on final firewall:
  diff output/current/tests-activation-policy-default.out \
       output/current/tests-activation-policy-accept.out

  diff output/current/tests-activation-policy-default.out \
       output/current/tests-activation-policy-drop.out

and so forth.


Writing new test configurations
===============================
Take a look at this file:
  tests/domain-names/succeed-with-activation-accept.conf

It is written in such a way as to allow for being run by Sanewall with
or without IPv6 capability (i.e. post or pre 1.1.0) and can caters for
the different defaults and variable names when run by FireHOL.


Recommended services for testing with
=====================================
All services fall into one of these criteria:
   simple - single UDP port
   simple - single TCP port
   simple - multiple ports
  complex - multiple ports

Whilst technically all complex services are unique, these four services
give a good broad coverage of overall behaviour:
     tftp - udp 69
      ssh - tcp 22
  eserver - tcp/4661 udp/4661 udp/4665
  hylafax - server listens on tcp/4559 + opens back to client tcp/4558
